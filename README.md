# Introduction

This repository contains code related to our paper, Geometric sparsification in recurrent neural nets, which can be accessed here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06290. For mathematical details we refer you to the paper.

The three folders in this repository contain code code relating to the three examples demonstrated in the paper. Navigation and word_example each contain detailed documentations of run options, which can be found in their own README files. We currently have not added full documentation for the adding problem, but its logic is identical to the other two applications. 

If you find the code in this repository helpful to your research tasks, please consider citing us as
